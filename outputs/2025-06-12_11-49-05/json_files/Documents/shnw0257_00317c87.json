We sought to develop a methodology that extracts a realistic and comprehensive under- N\nstanding of the patient journey using medical and pharmaceutical insurance claims data. 3\nMaterials and Methods: We processed a sample of 10 000 patient episodes (comprised of 113 215 back pain- 8\nrelated claims) into strings of characters, where each letter corresponds to a distinct encounter with the health- a\ncare system. We customized the Levenshtein edit distance algorithm to evaluate the level of similarity between g\neach pair of episodes based on both their content (types of events) and ordering (sequence of events). We then y\nused clustering to extract the main variations of the patient journey. gg\nResults: The algorithm resulted in 12 comprehensive and clinically distinct patterns (clusters) of patient jour- oO\n. . . . . ©\nneys that represent the main ways patients are diagnosed and treated for back pain. We further characterized =\ndemographic and utilization metrics for each cluster and observed clear differentiation between the clusters in 3\nterms of both clinical content and patient characteristics. Oo\nDiscussion: Despite being a complex and often noisy data source, administrative claims provide a unique longi- a\ntudinal overview of patient care across multiple service providers and locations. This methodology leverages =\nclaims to capture a data-driven understanding of how patients traverse the healthcare system. o\nConclusions: When tailored to various conditions and patient settings, this methodology can provide accurate &\noverviews of patient journeys and facilitate a shift toward high-quality practice patterns. &\n°\nKey words: Claims data, patient journey, clustering, edit distance, sequence alignment 3\n©\n—SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS >\na\nCc\nINTRODUCTION a\n. _. ly . . }\nMedical researchers have long pointed to the importance of under- from standard clinical guidelines.
