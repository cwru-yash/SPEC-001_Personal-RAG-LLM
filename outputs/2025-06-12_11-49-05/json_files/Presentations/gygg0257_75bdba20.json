These materials are confidential and proprietary.\nPotential adjustment to the Oxycontin market access strategy should consider Collegium situation \nand Purdue’s aspirations:\n• Initial analysis suggests Collegium needs at least $50Mn net sales growth to become profitable, and is \nexpected to close the profit gap in 2019.  With $20-30Mn expected sales in 2019, Collegium is not under \nstrong pressure for quick wins.  \n– Triggers that could change this assumption, and make them more aggressive in contracting include\n• Lower than expected win rate\n• Lack of meaningful growth\n• M&A activity\n• Given Purdue’s goals to ensure appropriate patient access, maintain realistic lifecycle planning of OxyContin \nand stabilize performance, Purdue’s strategy should include three elements, based on account type:\n• Most small to mid-size accounts: traditional gross-to-net optimization approach to maintain current \naccess\n• High volume accounts (e.g., CVS, ESI): retain current or potentially increase rebates slightly (e.g., 1-5 \npoints above Purdue’s financial break-even)\n• Limited number of high profile accounts that are small but well recognized, (e.g., UPMC health plan, \nMayo Clinic): potentially offer significantly above financial break-even to win\n• Maintain this strategy unless one of the Collegium triggers above occurs.  At that point, re-assess this \nstrategy with a bias toward securing access with high rebates to big accounts, noting this would be a costly \nchoice financially\nDRAFT\nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/gygg0257\n\n=== Page 2 Image 1 (OCR) ===\nQunoue).\n\n=== Page 2 Image 2 (OCR) ===\nguspue),\n\n=== Page 2 Image 3 (OCR) ===\nguspue)\n\n=== Page 2 Image 5 (OCR) ===\nguaoue)\n\n=== Page 2 Image 6 (OCR) ===\nuaoue).\n\n=== Page 3 ===\nPROPRIETARY AND \nCONFIDENTIAL\nPROPRIETARY AND \nCONFIDENTIAL\nProjected 2020 Xtampza financial performance and key drivers\n$ Mn\n-32\nGrowth due \nto price \nincrease\n15\n-19\n2018 loss \nfrom \noperations\nAdditional \nloss due to \nmarket \ndecline\n50\nRequired \nnet sales \ngrowth to \nbreak-\neven\n-14\nCOGS increase\n0\n2020 \noperating \nincome\nDIRECTIONAL ESTIMATION\nCollegium needs ~$50Mn incremental net sales to become profitable (estimates)\n3\n1 Assume ~60% share loss to Xampza and 60% overall gross-to-net reduction  SOURCE: Collegium 2018Q3 10-Q,  Cantor Fitzgerald Research, William Blair & Company\nPrivileged: This presentation contains draft proposals for discussion by Management and are subject to appropriate Purdue legal and regulatory review \nbefore they can be considered final.
