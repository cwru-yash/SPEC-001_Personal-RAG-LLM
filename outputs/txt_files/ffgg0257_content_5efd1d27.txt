High level assessment of potential strategic options for Oxycontin
1 Only include Commercial and Part D accounts
2 Assuming decline of branded Oxycodone ER at -1% YoY, and Xtampza losing 60-70%% of the market share due to exclusion
2 Assuming decline of branded Oxycodone ER at -1% YoY, and Xtampza share grow by 10-40% YoY
3 Assuming  Oxycontin share drops by 65%  in 2020  and by 30% YoY in 2021 and 2022 due to exclusion, and Xtampza captures 75% of the share drop from Oxycontin

We modeled out the economics for Xtampza, Payor and Oxycontin in different access scenarios
1 Minimum rebate rate required for plan sponsor to favor contracting with Oxycontin vs. exclusive deal with Xtampza, based on plan sponsor net cost analysis; “low share shift”
2  Maximum rebate rate that Oxycontin could pay so that net sales is higher or equal to the net sales in the “walk-away” scenario where Oxycontin is excluded without grandfathering

Assessment of current performance of Collegium
Collegium strategy going forward: key ingoing assumptions
• 2 product portfolio exclusively in pain management therapeutic area, with 
R&D pipeline all early life (Ph II or earlier) and concentrated in pain 
management1
• Facing “finite” market for its current portfolio, driven by:
– Overall U.S. ERO market continuing to decline (-15% YoY decline2 until 
2020)
– Likely genericization of extended-release oxycodone with abuse-deterrent 
formulations, leading to a market shift away from branded opioids
• Product portfolio is facing challenges
– Xtampza ER (oxycodone): $50.9M sales in Q1-Q3 20182
• Competing with an established market leader in a highly genericized class
– Nucynta (tapentadol): $156M sales in Q1-Q3 20182
• Slow launch since acquisition and experiencing share loss (-4% TRx from 
Q2-Q3 ’18)
• Collegium responsible for minimum $135M/yr royalty payment for first 4 
years of licensing regardless of product performance
• Collegium continues to invest in salesforce reps (~150) calling on specialists 
(~10,700) for both products
• Overall, Collegium is unprofitable ($31M loss from operations Q1-Q3 2018)
– ($0.50) EPS for Q3 ’18, missing Thomson Reuters’ consensus estimate of 
($0 36)
1 Collegium has one preclinical ADHD molecule
2 Based on Purdue internal projection
3 Based on Collegium 2018 Q3 10-Q 
• Given finite market 
outlook and Collegium’s 
need to quickly return to 
profitability, there are 2 
potential strategic 
choices:
– Reduce cost by 
downsizing salesforces, 
which could potentially 
lower expected sales 
growth
– Augment volume with 
aggressive bidding

Assessment of current performance of Collegium
Collegium strategy going forward: key ingoing assumptions
• 2 product portfolio exclusively in pain management therapeutic area, with 
R&D pipeline all early life (Ph II or earlier) and concentrated in pain 
management1
• Facing “finite” market for its current portfolio, driven by:
– Overall U.S. ERO market continuing to decline (-15% YoY decline2 until 
2020)
– Likely genericization of extended-release oxycodone with abuse-deterrent 
formulations, leading to a market shift away from branded opioids
• Product portfolio is facing challenges
– Xtampza ER (oxycodone): $50.9M sales in Q1-Q3 20182
• Competing with an established market leader in a highly genericized class
– Nucynta (tapentadol): $156M sales in Q1-Q3 20182
• Slow launch since acquisition and experiencing share loss (-4% TRx from 
Q2-Q3 ’18)
• Collegium responsible for minimum $135M/yr royalty payment for first 4 
years of licensing regardless of product performance
• Collegium continues to invest in salesforce reps (~150) calling on specialists 
(~10,700) for both products
• Overall, Collegium is unprofitable ($31M loss from operations Q1-Q3 2018)
– ($0.50) EPS for Q3 ’18, missing Thomson Reuters’ consensus estimate of 
($0 36)
1 Collegium has one preclinical ADHD molecule
2 Based on Purdue internal projection
3 Based on Collegium 2018 Q3 10-Q 
• Given finite market 
outlook and Collegium’s 
need to quickly return to 
profitability, there are 2 
potential strategic 
choices:
– Reduce cost by 
downsizing salesforces, 
which could potentially 
lower expected sales 
growth
– Augment volume with 
aggressive bidding
