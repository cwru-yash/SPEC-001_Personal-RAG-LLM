Executive summary

Privileged: This presentation contains draft proposals for discussion by Management and are subject to appropriate Purdue legal and regulatory review 
before they can be considered final. These materials are confidential and proprietary.
Potential adjustment to the Oxycontin market access strategy should consider Collegium situation 
and Purdue’s aspirations:
• Initial analysis suggests Collegium needs at least $50Mn net sales growth to become profitable, and is 
expected to close the profit gap in 2019.  With $20-30Mn expected sales in 2019, Collegium is not under 
strong pressure for quick wins.  
– Triggers that could change this assumption, and make them more aggressive in contracting include
• Lower than expected win rate
• Lack of meaningful growth
• M&A activity
• Given Purdue’s goals to ensure appropriate patient access, maintain realistic lifecycle planning of OxyContin 
and stabilize performance, Purdue’s strategy should include three elements, based on account type:
• Most small to mid-size accounts: traditional gross-to-net optimization approach to maintain current 
access
• High volume accounts (e.g., CVS, ESI): retain current or potentially increase rebates slightly (e.g., 1-5 
points above Purdue’s financial break-even)
• Limited number of high profile accounts that are small but well recognized, (e.g., UPMC health plan, 
Mayo Clinic): potentially offer significantly above financial break-even to win
• Maintain this strategy unless one of the Collegium triggers above occurs.  At that point, re-assess this 
strategy with a bias toward securing access with high rebates to big accounts, noting this would be a costly 
choice financially

1 Assuming Xtampza TRx growth rate of 15-20% YoY in 2019
2 Assume ~60% share loss to Xampza and 60% overall gross-to-net reduction
Collegium situation
• Xtampza is expected to grow by $20-
30Mn in 2019
– ~$10-15Mn growth from existing 
accounts1 
– ~$10Mn from new exclusive formulary 
wins2
• Despite growth slowing down, analysts 
expect Collegium to become 
profitable by end of 2019
• Investors are likely to limit pressure 
on Collegium management as long as 
Xtampza sales would continue to grow
–  “The investor community is more 
focused on a positive growth trajectory 
than on profitability ”
                      - Strategy and Corporate 
Finance expert
What this means?
• There is no strong pressure for 
Collegium to win large accounts using 
deep debate strategy
• Collegium can likely maintain healthy 
gross margin (e.g., below 60%) by 
following its stated strategy of focusing on 
regional accounts
• Triggers that could potentially make 
Collegium more aggressive in 
contracting include
–Lower than expected win rate with 
regional accounts or other accounts
–Lack of meaningful growth if not 
able to effectively converting Oxycontin 
share at Xtampza accounts
–M&A activity that changes investor 
expectations or reduces available cash

Purdue’s strategy: three elements
5
Privileged: This presentation contains draft proposals for discussion by Management and are subject to appropriate Purdue legal and regulatory review 
before they can be considered final. These materials are confidential and proprietary.
Choice of strategic elements needs to balance financial and non-financial 
considerations

Central objective:  Ensure appropriate patient access 

Other objectives: Realistic lifecycle planning of OxyContin and deliver 
performance stability
High profile 
wins
Traditional 
approach
Description
• Pay significantly above 
financial break-even to win 
small but well recognized 
accounts
• Need to ensure that rebate 
does not exceed contract 
rated with its PBM
• Gross-to-net optimization to 
retain access
• Pay up to our break-even 
rebate (above which it’s better 
off financially to walk away)
• Secure access by offering 
modest higher rebate points 
(1-5%) above financial break-
even 
Example applicable 
account 
• Small direct accounts, 
e.g. UPMC Commercial 
($0.6 Mn) that have 
minimal financial impact, 
but significant market 
influence due to public 
recognition
• Most small to mid-sized 
accounts:, e.g. Envision 
Rx Part D  ($5 Mn)
• Large commercial 
accounts: e.g. ESI 
Commercial ($110 Mn)
Benefits and risks
• Mitigate spill-over risks
• Financial trade-off are low 
given the small vs. 
stability risks
• Maintain favorable 
contract terms
• May loose the account in 
case of aggressive 
Collegium offer
• Secure broad patient 
access
• Payor may see this as 
opportunity to further 
negotiate

Modest rebate increase 
(e.g., 1-5pt points above 
financial break-even) 
could improve long 
term stability and 
secure broad patient 
access for OxyContin

If one of Collegium 
triggers above occurs, 
consider “building a 
high moat” to 
proactively blocking 
Xtampza from top 
commercial accounts, but 
this could lead to ~$100-

Shift

Modest rebate increase 
(e.g., 1-5pt points above 
financial break-even) 
could improve long 
term stability and 
secure broad patient 
access for OxyContin

If one of Collegium 
triggers above occurs, 
consider “building a 
high moat” to 
proactively blocking 
Xtampza from top 
commercial accounts, but 
this could lead to ~$100-
120Mn loss in 3-year 
net sales vs. 
traditional approach
