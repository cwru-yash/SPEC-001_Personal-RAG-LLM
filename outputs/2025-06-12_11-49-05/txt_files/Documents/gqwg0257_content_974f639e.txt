Defining Excellence in Purdue

Manufacturing Sites — Wave 1

Based on your request we have written this letter in order to outline our proposal to

assess current performance levels and next opportunities for improvement of the

first wave of Purdue’s manufacturing sites in Wilson, NC, Pickering, Canada,

Cyprus, Greece and Limburg, Germany. Based on our discussions its our

understanding that you would like these sites to participate in the POBOS

benchmarking effort and to complement the benchmarking with McKinsey expert

walkthroughs at each of these sites. Clearly, these findings will complement the

Betadine manufacturing strategy project which will be run in parallel. In this

memorandum, we describe our understanding of the scope, objectives and

deliverables, approach, team, and commercial terms for this effort.

SCOPE

The benchmarking and expert walkthroughs will cover the four Purdue commercial

manufacturing sites in Wilson, NC, Pickering, Canada, Cyprus, Greece and

Limburg, Germany.

OBJECTIVES AND DELIVERABLES

The primary objective of the effort is to understand the relative performance,

Operational Excellence maturity, cost position and productivity of the in-scope sites

compared with best-in-class competitors as well as the key levers that explain the

differences and potential next wave opportunities for Purdue’s manufacturing

strategy to go after.

All results will be summarized in a report and discussed with corporate

management in addition we will produce and conduct site level debriefs and report

outs with site management as desired. The final report will include roughly 25 key

analyses per site and recommendations for improvement opportunities that the site

might want to explore.

APPROACH

POBOS is based on a proven methodology for achieving a high degree of

comparability between pharmaceutical manufacturing sites. Data collection is based

on a standard Excel template that each plant is asked to fill out and includes a

formal sign-off by Finance ("data freeze"). We would schedule an initial kickoff

phone call with each site or a conference call to explain the template in detail and to

answer questions. Once the site returns the completed benchmarking template, we

conduct a consistency check and discuss any possible issues directly with the site

contact (typically, this 1s the site controller, CFO, or site manager). We will play

back the results to the site and request a formal sign-off ("edit freeze"), confirming

that all information was provided correctly.

The timing depends primarily on the submission of consistent data from a site. Once

data is available, we typically create the POBOS report within 2 weeks. We will

further bolster the POBOS findings with observations from | day expert

walkthroughs at each site. Typically, we sequence a site visit after POBOS data

collection so that the expert walkthrough can focus on assessing the areas of highest

opportunity and developing suggestions on potential improvement levers. The

typical overall timeline for a single site 1s 4-5 weeks consisting of 2 weeks data

collection, 1-2 weeks data analysis, | week expert walkthrough and report

preparation. We will work with you and your team to determine the appropriate

sequencing of site assessment to meet your needs.

We ensure confidentiality by displaying only blind results and restricting the data

processing to a very small core team within McKinsey that works in accordance

with the highest standards of confidentiality.

TEAM AND COMMERCIAL TERMS

To ensure a successful project, it will be key for Purdue to assign appropriate

priority to data collection at the site level and to provide a knowledgeable “guide”

and access to leaders to support the assigned expert during the site walkthrough.

Typically, we find that for POBOS data collection the site controller / finance head

or performance management head is the best point of contact for us. For the site

visits, typically the head of production and unit operation supervisors for pre-

designated focus areas are good hosts. Typically, we may also want to interview

the heads of Quality Assurance, Maintenance/Engineering and/or Pharm Tech.

The McKinsey leadership team for this effort will be Ted Fuhr and Katy George,

with additional support from other leaders in our operations practice. In addition,

Arnie Ghatak and Rob Rosiello will provide targeted leadership support, as helpful.

This leadership group would collectively provide overall guidance to the team,

bring relevant Purdue, pharmaceutical, and operations experience, and ensure the

full leveraging of McKinsey’s operations practice. The effort will be supported

directly by the global POBOS team headed by Thibaut Dedeurwaerder and a Lean

Operations expert(s) drawn from our global pool. Our team on the ground for

Betadine manufacturing strategy will provide on the ground coordination and

logistical support.

Our professional fees in support of this engagement would be $235,000 inclusive of

all fees and expenses under the assumption that the Betadine manufacturing strategy

effort 1s occurring in parallel.

We would invoice you when we issue the final report with the findings. Payment is

due within 7 days.

We remain fully committed to your success, and are excited about the potential

opportunity to help you accelerate this critical element of your strategy.
