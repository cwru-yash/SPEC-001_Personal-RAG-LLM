PROPRIETARY AND

Executive summary
• To understand most appropriate rebate for Prime Part D, we first need to understand the 
financial position and likely bidding strategy for Collegium
• Outside-in analysis of Collegium suggested an urgent need for at least $50Mn 
incremental net sales to support current strategy and stem losses 
• With only 2 ERO products in its portfolio, Collegium has limited options to close the gap, 
aside from additional acquisitions
• Given that Xtampza has very low market share and poor access right now, it would need to 
win at least a couple of big commercial accounts at almost any rebate level, while 
aiming for more profitable access elsewhere that matches strategy – e.g.,  Prime Part D given 
its strong regional focus
• Based on the above assumptions, we assessed different contracting scenarios for Prime Part 
D, (e.g., continuing current access status as the exclusive Oxycodone ER, parity with Xtampza 
as preferred brand) and likely impact
• Preliminary analyses indicate a break-even rebate of 45% to continue current access 
status, and a break-even rebate of 37% for parity with Xtampza

Key assumptions
• ERO market 
continues to decline 
at -15% year on 
year until 2020
– Consistent with 
Purdue Finance 
assumption
• Assume organic 
growth only (i.e., no 
BD deals)
• SG&A remains the 
same as current 
level
• Nucynta sales 
remains the same as 
current level – 
optimistic given it 
has been declining 
in the past 2 years
Key 
implications
• Clear need 
to quickly 
increase 
sales to 
reassure 
investors or 
sales force 
driven 
strategy at 
risk
• Likely need 
big wins 
quickly, 
rather than

Prime – continuing current access status or parity with Xtampza are best options to maintain 
appropriate access for patients while preserving best economics
1 Minimum rebate rate required for plan sponsor to favor contracting with Oxycontin vs. exclusive deal with Xtampza, based on plan sponsor net cost analysis; 
2 Maximum rebate rate that Oxycontin could pay so that net sales is higher or equal to the net sales in the “walk-away” scenario where Oxycontin is excluded without grandfathering
