Subject:

Addressing Stigma

PuSH colleagues,

We are pleased to share with you Shatterproof's recently released report, "A Movement to End Addiction

Stigma," and accompanying press release.

Building on a note that Liz Hilton Segel just shared with all NA Partners, we wanted to pass along to our

broader Practice as well. For the past year, we have been providing formal support to Shatterproof, a national

non-profit organization dedicated to reversing the addiction crisis in the U.S., in their development and

execution of a national strategy to help reduce the stigma around opioid addiction. This is a key effort within

our Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare.

Why is this a priority for us? Our country continues to face an opioid epidemic, and there is evidence that

COVID-19 has intensified the addition crisis. Even though it is a preventable, treatable health condition, only |

in 5 people with an opioid addiction get the care they need (and far fewer get needed care among racial and

ethnic minorities). Stigma, both personal and structural, is at the root of this. It is reflected in negative attitudes

towards people with addiction, and in institutional norms and policies that constrain resources and opportunities

for those with addiction. Stigma leads to lower rates of diagnosis, poorer quality of treatment, and a more

difficult road to stable recovery.

How have we been involved? In addition to providing technical support in developing the report and the

accompanying Addiction Stigma Index, we have committed to implementing the Employer Action Plan

outlined in the report. As part of our Firm’s broader Mind Matters initiative, we have rolled out a series of

actions to reduce stigma for our colleagues with mental and substance use disorders. These include:

e

Developing learning: Working with Firm Learning, Mind Matters, National Council of Behavioral

Health to develop two e-learning modules to create awareness for all colleagues and a deeper understanding for

our team leaders and managers, equipping them with tools to notice when teammates might need mental health

support and connect them with appropriate Firm resources; for our Partners, weaving mental health content into

existing digital learning and sharing a Mind Matters-authored Partner briefing document in townhalls to

encourage and support outreach to colleagues given heightened mental health needs due to COVID-19

e

Measuring stigma: Partnering with the McKinsey Firm People Survey team to measure stigma

throughout the Firm towards colleagues with a mental or substance use disorder — the results of the 2020 survey

have been summarized below

e

Sharing stories: Working with our Mind Matters team — including the Mental Health POCs — to collect

and share stories from around the Firm of colleagues dealing with mental and substance use disorders

e

Understanding policies/benefits: Collaborating with McKinsey Policies, Benefits and Communications

teams to ensure appropriate mental health supports are in-place across the firm and the language used

throughout our internal and external communications is non-stigmatizing

As mentioned, this year’s Firm People Survey included a question to measure level of stigma throughout the

firm towards colleagues with a mental or substance use disorder. We found that 62% of colleagues

somewhat/strongly/completely agree “individuals with mental health conditions who are treated can have

successful careers at McKinsey.” This was much lower than other inclusion/diversity questions; with more

than | in 3 Firm colleagues not believing there is support for those facing mental or substance use challenges,

we have a ways to go in addressing stigma and creating a supportive environment. View this note as a step

toward assuring you that we are here to support you, and we welcome your feedback on ways we can continue

to strengthen that support. As Kevin mentioned in his last weekly update, “This matters. Please do not

struggle alone.”

If your clients are interested in becoming an ally in this effort, we would welcome the opportunity to make

connections directly to Shatterproof. Please also share this new Shatterproof report as appropriate (sce draft

note below). We hope that by committing to this action plan ourselves and being transparent and humble about

the progress we still need to make, we can be an example to other employers across industries to lean in here as

well.

If you have any questions or want to learn more about the Shatterproof effort, please feel free to reach out to

me. Many thanks to our colleagues who have supported this effort, including: Tom Latkovic, Kana Enomoto,

Amit Shah, Sarun Charumilind, Raz Lewis, Etan Raskas, Caitlin Fross, Cheryl Healy, Casey Gardiner, Leah

Jimenez, Daniel Tartakovsky, Parag Jalan, Rosa Vinas Castells, Shrey Aggarwal, Savannah Dukes, Nikhil

Seshan, Jenny Cordina, Eric Levin, Eric Bochtler, Elena Mendez Escobar (alum). Thanks as well to our

colleagues in Mind Matters, Firm Learning, Firm People Survey, Communications, Policies, Benefits, and

AD&I for their critical partnership.

Best,

Erica

Draft note to clients:

Dear X,

Hope you are safe and healthy in these continued unprecedented times. I am reaching out to share a new report

that I think you may find interesting — Shatterproof, a national non-profit organization dedicated to reversing the

addiction crisis in the U.S., has recently published "A Movement to End Addiction Stigma." McKinsey

provided technical research support to this report through our Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare, as

part of our commitment to addressing the addiction crisis in our country, which evidence shows has been

intensified due to COVID-19.

As part of this national strategy, Shatterproof has developed action plans that organizations across the country

can adopt to reduce stigma. McKinsey has committed to implementing this plan across our Firm, and we

believe it can make a big difference. In case this is something you’d like to learn more about, I’d be happy to

connect you directly with Gary Mendell, Shatterproof CEO.

Best,

XX
