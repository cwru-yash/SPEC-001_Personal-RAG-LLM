ABSTRACT =I
=
Objective: In preference-sensitive conditions such as back pain, there can be high levels of variability in the tra- o
jectory of patient care. We sought to develop a methodology that extracts a realistic and comprehensive under- N
standing of the patient journey using medical and pharmaceutical insurance claims data. 3
Materials and Methods: We processed a sample of 10 000 patient episodes (comprised of 113 215 back pain- 8
related claims) into strings of characters, where each letter corresponds to a distinct encounter with the health- a
care system. We customized the Levenshtein edit distance algorithm to evaluate the level of similarity between g
each pair of episodes based on both their content (types of events) and ordering (sequence of events). We then y
used clustering to extract the main variations of the patient journey. gg
Results: The algorithm resulted in 12 comprehensive and clinically distinct patterns (clusters) of patient jour- oO
. . . . . ©
neys that represent the main ways patients are diagnosed and treated for back pain. We further characterized =
demographic and utilization metrics for each cluster and observed clear differentiation between the clusters in 3
terms of both clinical content and patient characteristics. Oo
Discussion: Despite being a complex and often noisy data source, administrative claims provide a unique longi- a
tudinal overview of patient care across multiple service providers and locations. This methodology leverages =
claims to capture a data-driven understanding of how patients traverse the healthcare system. o
Conclusions: When tailored to various conditions and patient settings, this methodology can provide accurate &
overviews of patient journeys and facilitate a shift toward high-quality practice patterns. &
