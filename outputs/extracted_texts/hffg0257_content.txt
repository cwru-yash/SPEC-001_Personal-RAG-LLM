▪The ERO market contraction of -7% in 
CVS Caremark Medicare is nearly half

▪Within the overall Caremark ERO market,

but within the major ERO brands1, 
OxyContin’s share fell 3pp (to 88%) while 
Xtampza ER gained 2pp
▪Caremark accounts for 53% of

▪Purdue ERO portfolio has preferred 
access in 79% of lives at CVS

lives receive non-preferred Xtampza 
▪If OxyContin is excluded while Xtampza ER 
is the preferred branded oxycodone ER, 
OxyContin will lose xx-xx% shares
▪Given the downside of exclusion, 
OxyContin should increase rebate no more 
than xx-xx%
▪From CVS perspective, the tipping point 
for excluding OxyContin will be xx-xx%
▪For every 1pt of share loss, OxyContin will 
hypothetically be willing to increase
