Based on our discussions its our\n\nunderstanding that you would like these sites to participate in the POBOS\n\nbenchmarking effort and to complement the benchmarking with McKinsey expert\n\nwalkthroughs at each of these sites. Clearly, these findings will complement the\n\nBetadine manufacturing strategy project which will be run in parallel. In this\n\nmemorandum, we describe our understanding of the scope, objectives and\n\ndeliverables, approach, team, and commercial terms for this effort.\n\nSCOPE\n\nThe benchmarking and expert walkthroughs will cover the four Purdue commercial\n\nmanufacturing sites in Wilson, NC, Pickering, Canada, Cyprus, Greece and\n\nLimburg, Germany.\n\nOBJECTIVES AND DELIVERABLES\n\nThe primary objective of the effort is to understand the relative performance,\n\nOperational Excellence maturity, cost position and productivity of the in-scope sites\n\ncompared with best-in-class competitors as well as the key levers that explain the\n\nMCK-MAAG-4813497\n\n=== Page 2 ===\nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/gqwg0257\n\n=== Page 2 Image 1 (OCR) ===\ndifferences and potential next wave opportunities for Purdue’s manufacturing\n\nstrategy to go after.\n\nAll results will be summarized in a report and discussed with corporate\n\nmanagement in addition we will produce and conduct site level debriefs and report\n\nouts with site management as desired. The final report will include roughly 25 key\n\nanalyses per site and recommendations for improvement opportunities that the site\n\nmight want to explore.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nPOBOS is based on a proven methodology for achieving a high degree of\n\ncomparability between pharmaceutical manufacturing sites. Data collection is based\n\non a standard Excel template that each plant is asked to fill out and includes a\n\nformal sign-off by Finance (\"data freeze\"). We would schedule an initial kickoff\n\nphone call with each site or a conference call to explain the template in detail and to\n\nanswer questions. Once the site returns the completed benchmarking template, we\n\nconduct a consistency check and discuss any possible issues directly with the site\n\ncontact (typically, this 1s the site controller, CFO, or site manager). We will play\n\nback the results to the site and request a formal sign-off (\"edit freeze\"), confirming\n\nthat all information was provided correctly.\n\nThe timing depends primarily on the submission of consistent data from a site. Once\n\ndata is available, we typically create the POBOS report within 2 weeks. We will\n\nfurther bolster the POBOS findings with observations from | day expert\n\nwalkthroughs at each site. Typically, we sequence a site visit after POBOS data\n\ncollection so that the expert walkthrough can focus on assessing the areas of highest\n\nopportunity and developing suggestions on potential improvement levers. The\n\ntypical overall timeline for a single site 1s 4-5 weeks consisting of 2 weeks data\n\ncollection, 1-2 weeks data analysis, | week expert walkthrough and report\n\npreparation. We will work with you and your team to determine the appropriate\n\nsequencing of site assessment to meet your needs.\n\nWe ensure confidentiality by displaying only blind results and restricting the data\n\nprocessing to a very small core team within McKinsey that works in accordance\n\nwith the highest standards of confidentiality.\n\nMcKinsey & Company | 2\n\nMCK-MAAG-4813497.000001\n\n=== Page 3 ===\nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/gqwg0257\n\n=== Page 3 Image 1 (OCR) ===\nTEAM AND COMMERCIAL TERMS\n\nTo ensure a successful project, it will be key for Purdue to assign appropriate\n\npriority to data collection at the site level and to provide a knowledgeable “guide”\n\nand access to leaders to support the assigned expert during the site walkthrough.\n\nTypically, we find that for POBOS data collection the site controller / finance head\n\nor performance management head is the best point of contact for us. For the site\n\nvisits, typically the head of production and unit operation supervisors for pre-\n\ndesignated focus areas are good hosts. Typically, we may also want to interview\n\nthe heads of Quality Assurance, Maintenance/Engineering and/or Pharm Tech.\n\nThe McKinsey leadership team for this effort will be Ted Fuhr and Katy George,\n\nwith additional support from other leaders in our operations practice. In addition,\n\nArnie Ghatak and Rob Rosiello will provide targeted leadership support, as helpful.\n\nThis leadership group would collectively provide overall guidance to the team,\n\nbring relevant Purdue, pharmaceutical, and operations experience, and ensure the\n\nfull leveraging of McKinsey’s operations practice. The effort will be supported\n\ndirectly by the global POBOS team headed by Thibaut Dedeurwaerder and a Lean\n\nOperations expert(s) drawn from our global pool. Our team on the ground for\n\nBetadine manufacturing strategy will provide on the ground coordination and\n\nlogistical support.\n\nOur professional fees in support of this engagement would be $235,000 inclusive of\n\nall fees and expenses under the assumption that the Betadine manufacturing strategy\n\neffort 1s occurring in parallel.\n\nWe would invoice you when we issue the final report with the findings. Payment is\n\ndue within 7 days.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nWe remain fully committed to your success, and are excited about the potential\n\nopportunity to help you accelerate this critical element of your strategy.\n\nMcKinsey & Company | 3\n\nMCK-MAAG-4813497.000002",
