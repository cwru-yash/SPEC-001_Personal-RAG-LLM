CONSENT JUDGMENT 
Plaintiff, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commonwealth” or “Plaintiff”) has 
filed a Complaint for a permanent injunction, damages and other relief in this matter pursuant to 
Mass. Gen. L. c. 93A, § 4 alleging that Defendant McKinsey & Company, Inc. United States

Act, G.L. c. 93A, § 2.  Plaintiff, by its counsel, and McKinsey, by its counsel, have agreed to the 
entry of this Consent Judgment (“Judgment”) by the Court without trial or adjudication of any 
issue of fact or law, and without finding or admission of wrongdoing or liability of any kind. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: 
I.  FINDINGS 
A. For purposes of this proceeding only, this Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter 
of this lawsuit and over the Parties (as defined below).  This Judgment shall not be 
construed or used as a waiver of any jurisdictional defense McKinsey may raise in any

E. McKinsey has cooperated with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s investigation and is 
willing to enter into this Judgment regarding the Covered Conduct in order to resolve the 
Attorney General’s claims and concerns under Mass. Gen. L. c. 93A, § 2 as to the matters 
addressed in this Judgment and thereby avoid significant expense, inconvenience, and 
uncertainty. 
F. The Massachusetts Attorney General acknowledges McKinsey’s good faith and 
responsible corporate citizenship in reaching this resolution. 
G. McKinsey is entering into this Judgment solely for the purpose of settlement, and nothing 
contained herein may be taken as or construed to be an admission or concession of any 
violation of law, rule, or regulation, or of any other matter of fact or law, or of any 
liability or wrongdoing, all of which McKinsey expressly denies. McKinsey does not 
admit any violation of the State Consumer Protection Laws (as defined below and set 
forth in footnote 1) and does not admit any wrongdoing that was or could have been 
alleged by the Attorney General before the date of the Judgment.  No part of this 
Judgment, including its statements and commitments, shall constitute evidence of any 
liability, fault, or wrongdoing by McKinsey. 
H. This Judgment shall not be construed or used as a waiver or limitation of any defense 
otherwise available to McKinsey in any other action, or of McKinsey’s right to defend 
itself from, or make any arguments in, any other regulatory, governmental, private

Judgment.  This Judgment is made without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law 
or finding of liability of any kind.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Attorney General 
may file an action to enforce the terms of this Judgment. 
I. No part of this Judgment shall create a private cause of action or confer any right to any 
third party for violation of any federal or state statute except that the Attorney General 
may file an action to enforce the terms of this Judgment.  It is the intent of the Parties that 
this Judgment shall not be binding or admissible in any other matter, including, but not 
limited to, any investigation or litigation, other than in connection with the enforcement 
of this Judgment.  This Judgment is not enforceable by any persons or entities besides the 
Massachusetts Attorney General, McKinsey, and this Court. 
J. In this action, McKinsey hereby accepts and expressly waives any defect with service of 
process or notice pursuant to Mass. Gen. L. c. 93A, § 4 and further consents to service of 
all process upon the below named counsel via email.

subject matter of the engagement does not specifically relate to opioids or other opioid-
based Schedule II or III controlled substances; or (2) health care providers, health plans, 
non-profit entities, governments, and quasi-governmental agencies, or any other client 
that is not a pharmaceutical manufacturer, for purposes of addressing a humanitarian 
health crisis, substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and mitigation or abatement 
efforts, or other public health benefit. 
C. Within eighteen months of the Effective Date for paragraph 4 below, and within twenty-
four months of the Effective Date for paragraphs 1-3 below, McKinsey shall develop and 
implement a document retention policy that provides as follows: 
1. McKinsey shall maintain a centralized document storage system (“Storage 
System”) such as a document management system or a file sharing platform.   
2. Unless prohibited by state, federal, or foreign law, McKinsey shall require its 
partners and employees, to the extent possible on a best-efforts basis, to create 
and maintain a final working papers file (“Final Working Papers File”) relating to 
client engagements on the Storage System. The Final Working Papers File shall 
include, but not be limited to, letters of proposal, contracts, memoranda, invoices, 
contracted deliverables, and close-out memoranda. 
3. McKinsey shall retain the Final Working Papers File for a minimum of seven 
years. 
4. McKinsey shall retain all communications and documents exchanged on any 
electronic mail (including associated attachments) or instant message system that 
McKinsey authorizes its personnel to use for five years. 
5. Nothing in this section shall prevent McKinsey from: (a) deleting documents or

=== Page 9 ===
 
-7- 
 
data as required by any state, federal, or foreign law or regulation, or (b) deleting 
documents or data as contractually required by a third party where such 
contractual requirement is reasonably necessary to allow the third party to comply 
with any state, federal, or foreign law or regulation. 
D. McKinsey shall implement a written policy requiring the termination of any employee 
that engages in the intentional spoliation of evidence for an improper purpose. 
E. In the next calendar year after the Effective Date, McKinsey shall include in the annual 
acknowledgement that all McKinsey partners are required to certify a section describing 
the terms and conditions of this Judgment, and McKinsey shall further hold additional 
annual training for partners in the Pharmaceuticals & Medical Products practice 
concerning the terms and conditions of this Judgment. 
F. McKinsey shall implement revisions to its client conflict policy pertaining to 
Government Clients (defined below), within 60 days of the Effective Date, consistent 
with paragraphs 1-4, below: 
1. McKinsey agrees to revise its conflict policy pertaining to potential engagements by 
any Settling State, county government, or municipal government (or any government 
agency of the aforementioned) (“Government Client”) to require a written disclosure 
of any material conflict (“Conflict Disclosure”) when (A) responding in writing to a 
request for proposal; (B) formally proposing work; (C) tendering an engagement 
letter to a Government Client; or (D) beginning work for a Government Client in the 
absence of an engagement letter, proposal, or request for proposal, whichever occurs 
first (“Triggering Event”).

=== Page 10 ===
 
-8- 
 
2. A material conflict exists for purposes of this Section III.F when, at the time of any 
Triggering Event, McKinsey is advising or in the past three years has previously 
advised an industry client on work which, in the view of a neutral and detached 
observer, is or was materially adverse to the work McKinsey would perform for the 
Government Client, such that when McKinsey is working or has worked to advance 
the goals or interests of the industry client it is likely to harm the goals or interests it 
is working to advance of the Government Client. 
3. Within 90 days of the Effective Date, McKinsey shall review each current 
engagement with a Government Client and provide a Conflict Disclosure where it 
would be otherwise required under this Section III.F for a new Government Client.   
4. Nothing in this Section III.F shall supersede or affect any legal or contractual 
obligation McKinsey may have pertaining to confidentiality, conflicts, or 
engagement of clients (“Client Obligations”).  The Conflict Disclosure shall not 
require McKinsey to violate any confidentiality obligations McKinsey has with its 
clients, and McKinsey satisfies its obligations under this section by providing a 
Conflict Disclosure (A) identifying the relevant industry; and (B) generally 
describing the work McKinsey performs for its industry client (without identifying 
its client).  If for whatever reason McKinsey determines that its Client Obligations 
preclude a Conflict Disclosure, McKinsey agrees to decline the work for the 
Government Client. 
G. McKinsey shall not use, assist, or employ any third party to engage in any activity that 
McKinsey itself would be prohibited from engaging in pursuant to this Judgment.

H. The foregoing injunctive terms may be amended by agreement between McKinsey and 
Massachusetts without this Court’s approval or amendment of this Judgment. 
IV. PUBLIC ACCESS TO MCKINSEY DOCUMENTS 
A. Documents Subject to Public Disclosure 
1.  The following documents shall be produced by McKinsey to each Settling State and are 
subject to public disclosure in perpetuity as part of a document disclosure program, except for 
the redactions authorized by Section B: 
All non-privileged documents McKinsey produced to any of the Settling States in response to 
investigative demands or other formal or informal requests related to opioids in 2019, 2020, or 
2021, prior to the date of this Judgment, that fall within the following categories: 
a. All communications with Purdue Pharma LP (“Purdue”); 
b. All documents reflecting or concerning McKinsey’s work for Purdue; 
c. All communications with Endo Pharmaceuticals (“Endo”), Johnson & Johnson, or 
Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (“Mallinckrodt”) related to opioids; 
d. All documents reflecting or concerning McKinsey’s work related to opioids for Endo, 
Johnson & Johnson, or Mallinckrodt; 
e. All documents and communications sent or received by individual consultants agreed 
upon by McKinsey and the Settling States related to opioids or the opioid crisis; 
f. All documents listed by Bates number in Appendix A. 
2.  All documents produced under this provision shall be provided in electronic format with all 
related metadata.  McKinsey and the Settling States will work cooperatively to develop technical 
specifications for the productions.

B. Information That May Be Redacted 
The following categories of information are exempt from public disclosure: 
1. Information subject to trade secret protection.  A “trade secret” is information, including a 
formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process, that (a) derives 
independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or 
to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure and use; and (b) is the 
subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  Even if the 
information falls within the definition, “trade secret” does not include information reflecting 
opioid sales or promotional strategies, tactics, targeting, or data, or internal communications 
related to sales or promotion of opioids. 
2. Confidential personal information. “Confidential personal information” means individual 
Social Security or tax identification numbers, personal financial account numbers, passport 
numbers, driver license numbers, home addresses, home telephone numbers, personal email 
addresses, and other personally identifiable information protected by law from disclosure. 
“Confidential personal information” does not include the names of officers, directors, employees, 
agents, or attorneys of McKinsey, Purdue, Endo, Johnson & Johnson, or Mallinckrodt, or of a 
government agency. 
3. Information that is inappropriate for public disclosure because it is subject to personal privacy 
interests recognized by law (e.g., HIPAA), or contractual rights of third parties (including 
McKinsey’s clients) that McKinsey may not abrogate.  McKinsey shall make its best efforts to 
ensure that disclosure into the document repository is not limited or prohibited by contractual 
rights of Purdue with regard to any documents, or by contractual rights of Endo, Johnson & 
Johnson, or Mallinckrodt with regard to documents related to opioids. 
Source:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282


=== Page 13 ===
 
-11- 
 
4. Information regarding McKinsey partners’ or employees’ personal or professional matters 
unrelated to McKinsey or opioids, including but not limited to emails produced by McKinsey 
custodians discussing vacation or sick leave, family, or other personal matters. 
C. Redaction of Documents Containing Protected Information 
1.  Whenever a document contains information subject to a claim of exemption pursuant to 
Section B, McKinsey shall produce the document in redacted form.  Such redactions shall 
indicate that trade secret and/or private information, as appropriate, has been redacted.  
Redactions shall be limited to the minimum redactions possible to protect the legally recognized 
individual privacy interests and trade secrets identified above. 
2.  McKinsey shall produce to each Settling State a log noting each document redacted.  The log 
shall also provide fields stating the basis for redacting the document, with sufficient detail to 
allow an assessment of the merits of the assertion.  The log is subject to public disclosure in 
perpetuity.  The log shall be produced simultaneously with the production of documents required 
by Section IV.F. 
3.  In addition to the redacted documents, McKinsey shall, upon any Settling State’s request, also 
produce all documents identified in Section IV.A above in unredacted form to such Settling State 
at the same time.  The redacted documents produced by McKinsey may be publicly disclosed in 
accordance with Section IV.E below.  The unredacted documents produced by McKinsey to a 
Settling State shall be available only to such State unless McKinsey’s claim of exemption under 
Section IV.B is successfully challenged in accordance with Section IV.C.4 or the trade secret 
designation expires in accordance with Section IV.D. 
4.  Anyone, including members of the public and the press, may challenge the appropriateness of 
redactions by providing notice to McKinsey and a Settling State, which Settling State shall

=== Page 14 ===
 
-12- 
 
review the challenge and inform McKinsey of whether the challenge has sufficient merit to 
warrant triggering the remaining provisions of this paragraph.  If the challenge is not resolved by 
agreement, it must be resolved in the first instance by a third party jointly appointed by the 
Settling State and McKinsey to resolve such challenges.  The decision of the third party may be 
appealed to a court with enforcement authority over this Judgment.  If not so appealed, the third 
party’s decision is final.  In connection with such challenge, a Settling State may provide copies 
of relevant unredacted documents to the parties or the decisionmaker, subject to appropriate 
confidentiality and/or in camera review protections, as determined by the decisionmaker. 
D. Review of Trade Secret Redactions 
Seven years after McKinsey completes the production of its documents in accordance with 
Section IV.F and upon notice by a Settling State, McKinsey shall review all trade secret 
assertions made in accordance with Section IV.B.  The newly unredacted documents may then be 
publicly disclosed by a Settling State in accordance with Section IV.E.  McKinsey shall produce 
to each Settling State an updated redaction log justifying its designations of the remaining trade 
secret redactions. 
E. Public Disclosure through a Document Repository 
Each Settling State may publicly disclose all documents covered by Section IV.A through a 
public repository maintained by a governmental, non-profit, or academic institution.  Each 
Settling State may specify the terms of any such repository’s use of those documents, including 
allowing the repository to index and make searchable all documents subject to public disclosure, 
including the metadata associated with those documents.  When providing the documents 
covered by Section IV.A to a public repository, no Settling State shall include or attach within 
the document set any characterization of the content of the documents.  For the avoidance of 
Source:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282


=== Page 15 ===
 
-13- 
 
doubt, nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any Settling State from publicly discussing the 
documents covered by Section IV.A. 
F. Timeline for Production 
McKinsey shall produce all documents required by Section IV.A within nine months from the 
Effective Date. 
G. Costs 
The Settling States may allocate funds from the Settlement to fund the allocable share of all 
reasonable costs and expenses associated with the public disclosure and storage of McKinsey’s 
documents through any public repository. 
V.   PAYMENT 
1.

harms caused to the Settling States and their citizens by the opioid epidemic within each State 
and to recover the costs incurred by the Settling State in investigating and pursuing these

Massachusetts Attorney General will allocate the Commonwealth’s share as follows: (a) $11,727,291 will be deposited 
into the Opioid Recovery and Remediation Trust Fund established pursuant to M.G.L. c. 10, §35OOO to mitigate the 
impacts of the opioid epidemic in the Commonwealth; and (b) $1,500,000 will be deposited to an account or accounts 
held by the Office of the Attorney General, pursuant to G.L. c. 12 § 4A, to be used in the Attorney General’s sole 
discretion to (i) promote initiatives designed to improve care and treatment related to prescription medications or 
otherwise assist Massachusetts health care consumers and programs, or (ii) support efforts to enforce compliance with 
state and federal laws and regulations that protect Massachusetts health care consumers.

$7,000,000 and second to reimburse participating States for documented costs and expenses 
associated with the investigation of McKinsey submitted by or before March 1, 2021, subject to 
reasonable parameters to be set by NAAG.  The remaining balance of the NAAG Fund shall be

benefit of the public.   
2. 
McKinsey shall pay a total amount of $573,919,331 as follows: 1) the initial payment of 
$478,266,111 including the $15,000,000 payment to NAAG, shall be paid by 60 days after the 
Effective Date; 2) the second payment of $23,913,305 shall be paid no later than one year from

McKinsey under any policies or contracts of insurance insuring McKinsey.  
VI.     ENFORCEMENT 
A. For the purposes of resolving disputes with respect to compliance with this Judgment, 
should the Massachusetts Attorney General have a reasonable basis to believe that 
McKinsey has engaged in a practice that violates a provision of this Judgment subsequent 
to the Effective Date, then the Massachusetts Attorney General shall notify McKinsey in 
writing of the specific objection, identify with particularity the provision of this Judgment 
that the practice appears to violate, and give McKinsey 30 days to respond to the

notification; provided, however, that the Attorney General may take any action if the 
Attorney General believes that, because of the specific practice, a threat to the health or 
safety of the public requires immediate action. 
B. Upon receipt of written notice, McKinsey shall provide a good faith written response to 
the Attorney General’s notification, containing either a statement explaining why 
McKinsey believes it is in compliance with the Judgment, or a detailed explanation of 
how the alleged violation occurred and a statement explaining how McKinsey intends to 
remedy the alleged breach.  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to limit the 
Commonwealth’s civil investigative demand (“CID”) or investigative subpoena 
authority, to the extent such authority exists under applicable law, and McKinsey reserves 
all of its rights in responding to a CID or investigative subpoena issued pursuant to such 
authority. 
C. The Massachusetts Attorney General may agree, in writing, to provide McKinsey with 
additional time beyond the 30 days to respond to a notice provided under section V.A. 
above without Court approval. 
D. Upon giving McKinsey 30 days to respond to the notification described above, the 
Massachusetts Attorney General shall also be permitted reasonable access to inspect and 
copy relevant, non-privileged, non-work product records and documents in the 
possession, custody, or control of McKinsey that relate to McKinsey’s compliance with 
each provision of this Judgment pursuant to the Commonwealth’s CID or investigative 
subpoena authority. 
E. The Massachusetts Attorney General may assert any claim that McKinsey has violated 
this Judgment in a separate civil action to enforce compliance with this Judgment, or may

-16- 
 
seek any other relief afforded by law for violations of the Judgment, but only after 
providing McKinsey an opportunity to respond to the notification described in paragraph 
VI.A above; provided, however, that the Attorney General may take any action if the 
Attorney General believes that, because of the specific practice, a threat to the health or 
safety of the public requires immediate action. 
VII. RELEASE
