Within eighteen months of the Effective Date for paragraph 4 below, and within twenty-\nfour months of the Effective Date for paragraphs 1-3 below, McKinsey shall develop and \nimplement a document retention policy that provides as follows: \n1. McKinsey shall maintain a centralized document storage system (“Storage \nSystem”) such as a document management system or a file sharing platform.   \n2. Unless prohibited by state, federal, or foreign law, McKinsey shall require its \npartners and employees, to the extent possible on a best-efforts basis, to create \nand maintain a final working papers file (“Final Working Papers File”) relating to \nclient engagements on the Storage System. The Final Working Papers File shall \ninclude, but not be limited to, letters of proposal, contracts, memoranda, invoices, \ncontracted deliverables, and close-out memoranda. \n3. McKinsey shall retain the Final Working Papers File for a minimum of seven \nyears. \n4. McKinsey shall retain all communications and documents exchanged on any \nelectronic mail (including associated attachments) or instant message system that \nMcKinsey authorizes its personnel to use for five years. \n5. Nothing in this section shall prevent McKinsey from: (a) deleting documents or \nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282\n\n\n=== Page 9 ===\n \n-7- \n \ndata as required by any state, federal, or foreign law or regulation, or (b) deleting \ndocuments or data as contractually required by a third party where such \ncontractual requirement is reasonably necessary to allow the third party to comply \nwith any state, federal, or foreign law or regulation. \nD. McKinsey shall implement a written policy requiring the termination of any employee \nthat engages in the intentional spoliation of evidence for an improper purpose. \nE. In the next calendar year after the Effective Date, McKinsey shall include in the annual \nacknowledgement that all McKinsey partners are required to certify a section describing \nthe terms and conditions of this Judgment, and McKinsey shall further hold additional \nannual training for partners in the Pharmaceuticals & Medical Products practice \nconcerning the terms and conditions of this Judgment. \nF. McKinsey shall implement revisions to its client conflict policy pertaining to \nGovernment Clients (defined below), within 60 days of the Effective Date, consistent \nwith paragraphs 1-4, below: \n1. McKinsey agrees to revise its conflict policy pertaining to potential engagements by \nany Settling State, county government, or municipal government (or any government \nagency of the aforementioned) (“Government Client”) to require a written disclosure \nof any material conflict (“Conflict Disclosure”) when (A) responding in writing to a \nrequest for proposal; (B) formally proposing work; (C) tendering an engagement \nletter to a Government Client; or (D) beginning work for a Government Client in the \nabsence of an engagement letter, proposal, or request for proposal, whichever occurs \nfirst (“Triggering Event”).  \nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282\n\n\n=== Page 10 ===\n \n-8- \n \n2. A material conflict exists for purposes of this Section III.F when, at the time of any \nTriggering Event, McKinsey is advising or in the past three years has previously \nadvised an industry client on work which, in the view of a neutral and detached \nobserver, is or was materially adverse to the work McKinsey would perform for the \nGovernment Client, such that when McKinsey is working or has worked to advance \nthe goals or interests of the industry client it is likely to harm the goals or interests it \nis working to advance of the Government Client. \n3. Within 90 days of the Effective Date, McKinsey shall review each current \nengagement with a Government Client and provide a Conflict Disclosure where it \nwould be otherwise required under this Section III.F for a new Government Client.   \n4. Nothing in this Section III.F shall supersede or affect any legal or contractual \nobligation McKinsey may have pertaining to confidentiality, conflicts, or \nengagement of clients (“Client Obligations”).  The Conflict Disclosure shall not \nrequire McKinsey to violate any confidentiality obligations McKinsey has with its \nclients, and McKinsey satisfies its obligations under this section by providing a \nConflict Disclosure (A) identifying the relevant industry; and (B) generally \ndescribing the work McKinsey performs for its industry client (without identifying \nits client).  If for whatever reason McKinsey determines that its Client Obligations \npreclude a Conflict Disclosure, McKinsey agrees to decline the work for the \nGovernment Client. \nG. McKinsey shall not use, assist, or employ any third party to engage in any activity that \nMcKinsey itself would be prohibited from engaging in pursuant to this Judgment. \nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282\n\n\n=== Page 11 ===\n \n-9- \n \nH. The foregoing injunctive terms may be amended by agreement between McKinsey and \nMassachusetts without this Court’s approval or amendment of this Judgment. \nIV. PUBLIC ACCESS TO MCKINSEY DOCUMENTS \nA. Documents Subject to Public Disclosure \n1.  The following documents shall be produced by McKinsey to each Settling State and are \nsubject to public disclosure in perpetuity as part of a document disclosure program, except for \nthe redactions authorized by Section B: \nAll non-privileged documents McKinsey produced to any of the Settling States in response to \ninvestigative demands or other formal or informal requests related to opioids in 2019, 2020, or \n2021, prior to the date of this Judgment, that fall within the following categories: \na. All communications with Purdue Pharma LP (“Purdue”); \nb. All documents reflecting or concerning McKinsey’s work for Purdue; \nc. All communications with Endo Pharmaceuticals (“Endo”), Johnson & Johnson, or \nMallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (“Mallinckrodt”) related to opioids; \nd. All documents reflecting or concerning McKinsey’s work related to opioids for Endo, \nJohnson & Johnson, or Mallinckrodt; \ne. All documents and communications sent or received by individual consultants agreed \nupon by McKinsey and the Settling States related to opioids or the opioid crisis; \nf. All documents listed by Bates number in Appendix A. \n2.  All documents produced under this provision shall be provided in electronic format with all \nrelated metadata.  McKinsey and the Settling States will work cooperatively to develop technical \nspecifications for the productions. \n \nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282\n\n\n=== Page 12 ===\n \n-10- \n \nB. Information That May Be Redacted \nThe following categories of information are exempt from public disclosure: \n1. Information subject to trade secret protection.  A “trade secret” is information, including a \nformula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process, that (a) derives \nindependent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or \nto other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure and use; and (b) is the \nsubject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  Even if the \ninformation falls within the definition, “trade secret” does not include information reflecting \nopioid sales or promotional strategies, tactics, targeting, or data, or internal communications \nrelated to sales or promotion of opioids. \n2. Confidential personal information. “Confidential personal information” means individual \nSocial Security or tax identification numbers, personal financial account numbers, passport \nnumbers, driver license numbers, home addresses, home telephone numbers, personal email \naddresses, and other personally identifiable information protected by law from disclosure. \n“Confidential personal information” does not include the names of officers, directors, employees, \nagents, or attorneys of McKinsey, Purdue, Endo, Johnson & Johnson, or Mallinckrodt, or of a \ngovernment agency. \n3. Information that is inappropriate for public disclosure because it is subject to personal privacy \ninterests recognized by law (e.g., HIPAA), or contractual rights of third parties (including \nMcKinsey’s clients) that McKinsey may not abrogate.  McKinsey shall make its best efforts to \nensure that disclosure into the document repository is not limited or prohibited by contractual \nrights of Purdue with regard to any documents, or by contractual rights of Endo, Johnson & \nJohnson, or Mallinckrodt with regard to documents related to opioids. \nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282\n\n\n=== Page 13 ===\n \n-11- \n \n4. Information regarding McKinsey partners’ or employees’ personal or professional matters \nunrelated to McKinsey or opioids, including but not limited to emails produced by McKinsey \ncustodians discussing vacation or sick leave, family, or other personal matters. \nC. Redaction of Documents Containing Protected Information \n1.  Whenever a document contains information subject to a claim of exemption pursuant to \nSection B, McKinsey shall produce the document in redacted form.  Such redactions shall \nindicate that trade secret and/or private information, as appropriate, has been redacted.  \nRedactions shall be limited to the minimum redactions possible to protect the legally recognized \nindividual privacy interests and trade secrets identified above. \n2.  McKinsey shall produce to each Settling State a log noting each document redacted.  The log \nshall also provide fields stating the basis for redacting the document, with sufficient detail to \nallow an assessment of the merits of the assertion.  The log is subject to public disclosure in \nperpetuity.  The log shall be produced simultaneously with the production of documents required \nby Section IV.F. \n3.  In addition to the redacted documents, McKinsey shall, upon any Settling State’s request, also \nproduce all documents identified in Section IV.A above in unredacted form to such Settling State \nat the same time.  The redacted documents produced by McKinsey may be publicly disclosed in \naccordance with Section IV.E below.  The unredacted documents produced by McKinsey to a \nSettling State shall be available only to such State unless McKinsey’s claim of exemption under \nSection IV.B is successfully challenged in accordance with Section IV.C.4 or the trade secret \ndesignation expires in accordance with Section IV.D. \n4.  Anyone, including members of the public and the press, may challenge the appropriateness of \nredactions by providing notice to McKinsey and a Settling State, which Settling State shall \nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282\n\n\n=== Page 14 ===\n \n-12- \n \nreview the challenge and inform McKinsey of whether the challenge has sufficient merit to \nwarrant triggering the remaining provisions of this paragraph.  If the challenge is not resolved by \nagreement, it must be resolved in the first instance by a third party jointly appointed by the \nSettling State and McKinsey to resolve such challenges.  The decision of the third party may be \nappealed to a court with enforcement authority over this Judgment.  If not so appealed, the third \nparty’s decision is final.  In connection with such challenge, a Settling State may provide copies \nof relevant unredacted documents to the parties or the decisionmaker, subject to appropriate \nconfidentiality and/or in camera review protections, as determined by the decisionmaker. \nD. Review of Trade Secret Redactions \nSeven years after McKinsey completes the production of its documents in accordance with \nSection IV.F and upon notice by a Settling State, McKinsey shall review all trade secret \nassertions made in accordance with Section IV.B.  The newly unredacted documents may then be \npublicly disclosed by a Settling State in accordance with Section IV.E.  McKinsey shall produce \nto each Settling State an updated redaction log justifying its designations of the remaining trade \nsecret redactions. \nE. Public Disclosure through a Document Repository \nEach Settling State may publicly disclose all documents covered by Section IV.A through a \npublic repository maintained by a governmental, non-profit, or academic institution.  Each \nSettling State may specify the terms of any such repository’s use of those documents, including \nallowing the repository to index and make searchable all documents subject to public disclosure, \nincluding the metadata associated with those documents.  When providing the documents \ncovered by Section IV.A to a public repository, no Settling State shall include or attach within \nthe document set any characterization of the content of the documents.  For the avoidance of \nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/qxwd0282\n\n\n=== Page 15 ===\n \n-13- \n \ndoubt, nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any Settling State from publicly discussing the \ndocuments covered by Section IV.A. \nF. Timeline for Production \nMcKinsey shall produce all documents required by Section IV.A within nine months from the \nEffective Date. \nG. Costs \nThe Settling States may allocate funds from the Settlement to fund the allocable share of all \nreasonable costs and expenses associated with the public disclosure and storage of McKinsey’s \ndocuments through any public repository. \nV.
