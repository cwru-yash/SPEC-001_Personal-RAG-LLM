For the past year, we have been providing formal support to Shatterproof, a national\n\nnon-profit organization dedicated to reversing the addiction crisis in the U.S., in their development and\n\nexecution of a national strategy to help reduce the stigma around opioid addiction. This is a key effort within\n\nour Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare.\n\nWhy is this a priority for us? Our country continues to face an opioid epidemic, and there is evidence that\n\nCOVID-19 has intensified the addition crisis. Even though it is a preventable, treatable health condition, only |\n\nin 5 people with an opioid addiction get the care they need (and far fewer get needed care among racial and\n\nethnic minorities). Stigma, both personal and structural, is at the root of this. It is reflected in negative attitudes\n\ntowards people with addiction, and in institutional norms and policies that constrain resources and opportunities\n\nfor those with addiction. Stigma leads to lower rates of diagnosis, poorer quality of treatment, and a more\n\ndifficult road to stable recovery.\n\nHow have we been involved? In addition to providing technical support in developing the report and the\n\naccompanying Addiction Stigma Index, we have committed to implementing the Employer Action Plan\n\noutlined in the report. As part of our Firm’s broader Mind Matters initiative, we have rolled out a series of\n\nactions to reduce stigma for our colleagues with mental and substance use disorders. These include:\n\ne\n\nDeveloping learning: Working with Firm Learning, Mind Matters, National Council of Behavioral\n\nHealth to develop two e-learning modules to create awareness for all colleagues and a deeper understanding for\n\nour team leaders and managers, equipping them with tools to notice when teammates might need mental health\n\nsupport and connect them with appropriate Firm resources; for our Partners, weaving mental health content into\n\nexisting digital learning and sharing a Mind Matters-authored Partner briefing document in townhalls to\n\nencourage and support outreach to colleagues given heightened mental health needs due to COVID-19\n\ne\n\nMeasuring stigma: Partnering with the McKinsey Firm People Survey team to measure stigma\n\nthroughout the Firm towards colleagues with a mental or substance use disorder — the results of the 2020 survey\n\nhave been summarized below\n\ne\n\nSharing stories: Working with our Mind Matters team — including the Mental Health POCs — to collect\n\nand share stories from around the Firm of colleagues dealing with mental and substance use disorders\n\ne\n\nUnderstanding policies/benefits: Collaborating with McKinsey Policies, Benefits and Communications\n\nteams to ensure appropriate mental health supports are in-place across the firm and the language used\n\nthroughout our internal and external communications is non-stigmatizing\n\nMCK-MAAG-2361 966\n\n=== Page 2 ===\nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/trbw0256\n\n=== Page 2 Image 1 (OCR) ===\nAs mentioned, this year’s Firm People Survey included a question to measure level of stigma throughout the\n\nfirm towards colleagues with a mental or substance use disorder. We found that 62% of colleagues\n\nsomewhat/strongly/completely agree “individuals with mental health conditions who are treated can have\n\nsuccessful careers at McKinsey.” This was much lower than other inclusion/diversity questions; with more\n\nthan | in 3 Firm colleagues not believing there is support for those facing mental or substance use challenges,\n\nwe have a ways to go in addressing stigma and creating a supportive environment. View this note as a step\n\ntoward assuring you that we are here to support you, and we welcome your feedback on ways we can continue\n\nto strengthen that support. As Kevin mentioned in his last weekly update, “This matters. Please do not\n\nstruggle alone.”\n\nIf your clients are interested in becoming an ally in this effort, we would welcome the opportunity to make\n\nconnections directly to Shatterproof. Please also share this new Shatterproof report as appropriate (sce draft\n\nnote below). We hope that by committing to this action plan ourselves and being transparent and humble about\n\nthe progress we still need to make, we can be an example to other employers across industries to lean in here as\n\nwell.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to learn more about the Shatterproof effort, please feel free to reach out to\n\nme. Many thanks to our colleagues who have supported this effort, including: Tom Latkovic, Kana Enomoto,\n\nAmit Shah, Sarun Charumilind, Raz Lewis, Etan Raskas, Caitlin Fross, Cheryl Healy, Casey Gardiner, Leah\n\nJimenez, Daniel Tartakovsky, Parag Jalan, Rosa Vinas Castells, Shrey Aggarwal, Savannah Dukes, Nikhil\n\nSeshan, Jenny Cordina, Eric Levin, Eric Bochtler, Elena Mendez Escobar (alum). Thanks as well to our\n\ncolleagues in Mind Matters, Firm Learning, Firm People Survey, Communications, Policies, Benefits, and\n\nAD&I for their critical partnership.\n\nBest,\n\nErica\n\nHC DHE EE OK CO HC OC OC EC OIE CO EOC DC EC OE CO EOC OIC EC OIC COC COC OIC IC OK CO 2 OC OC EC OIC COIR 2 OC 2 IC OIC C3 2 OC DK IC OIE COIR FC OC OC IC OIC C3 2K OC OC IC OK COIR 2 3 OC 9 2 OC 3K 2\n\nDraft note to clients:\n\nDear X,\n\nHope you are safe and healthy in these continued unprecedented times. I am reaching out to share a new report\n\nthat I think you may find interesting — Shatterproof, a national non-profit organization dedicated to reversing the\n\naddiction crisis in the U.S., has recently published \"A Movement to End Addiction Stigma.\" McKinsey\n\nprovided technical research support to this report through our Center for Societal Benefit through Healthcare, as\n\npart of our commitment to addressing the addiction crisis in our country, which evidence shows has been\n\nintensified due to COVID-19.\n\nAs part of this national strategy, Shatterproof has developed action plans that organizations across the country\n\ncan adopt to reduce stigma. McKinsey has committed to implementing this plan across our Firm, and we\n\nbelieve it can make a big difference. In case this is something you’d like to learn more about, I’d be happy to\n\nconnect you directly with Gary Mendell, Shatterproof CEO.\n\nBest,\n\nXX\n\nMCK-MAAG-2361966.000001",
