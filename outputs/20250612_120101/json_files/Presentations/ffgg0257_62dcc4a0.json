strategy going forward: key ingoing assumptions\n• 2 product portfolio exclusively in pain management therapeutic area, with \nR&D pipeline all early life (Ph II or earlier) and concentrated in pain \nmanagement1\n• Facing “finite” market for its current portfolio, driven by:\n– Overall U.S. ERO market continuing to decline (-15% YoY decline2 until \n2020)\n– Likely genericization of extended-release oxycodone with abuse-deterrent \nformulations, leading to a market shift away from branded opioids\n• Product portfolio is facing challenges\n– Xtampza ER (oxycodone): $50.9M sales in Q1-Q3 20182\n• Competing with an established market leader in a highly genericized class\n– Nucynta (tapentadol): $156M sales in Q1-Q3 20182\n• Slow launch since acquisition and experiencing share loss (-4% TRx from \nQ2-Q3 ’18)\n• Collegium responsible for minimum $135M/yr royalty payment for first 4 \nyears of licensing regardless of product performance\n• Collegium continues to invest in salesforce reps (~150) calling on specialists \n(~10,700) for both products\n• Overall, Collegium is unprofitable ($31M loss from operations Q1-Q3 2018)\n– ($0.50) EPS for Q3 ’18, missing Thomson Reuters’ consensus estimate of \n($0 36)\n1 Collegium has one preclinical ADHD molecule\n2 Based on Purdue internal projection\n3 Based on Collegium 2018 Q3 10-Q \n• Given finite market \noutlook and Collegium’s \nneed to quickly return to \nprofitability, there are 2 \npotential strategic \nchoices:\n– Reduce cost by \ndownsizing salesforces, \nwhich could potentially \nlower expected sales \ngrowth\n– Augment volume with \naggressive bidding \nSOURCE: SEC filings, Internal research\nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/ffgg0257\n\n\n=== Page 8 ===\nPROPRIETARY AND
