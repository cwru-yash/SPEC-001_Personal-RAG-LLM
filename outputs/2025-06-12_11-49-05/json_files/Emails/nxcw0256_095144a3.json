A daily podcast of Wall Street Breakfast will be available by 8:00 a.m. on Seeking Alpha,\n\niTunes, Stitcher and Spotify.\n\nThe precious metals rally gathered pace overnight as spot gold rose as much as 0.6% to a record $2,031.14 per ounce,\n\nwhile spot silver advanced as much as 1.3% to $26.3473/oz. The printers are running... Investors are counting on even more\n\nspending in the U.S. to combat the pandemic's fallout as White House negotiators work \"around the clock\" to reach a stimulus\n\ndeal by the end of the week, while markets also latched on to comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly that the\n\nU.S. economy will need more support than initially thought. Search for a new reserve currency? Goldman Sachs says gold may\n\nclimb to $2,300/o0z. and RBC Capital puts the odds ofa rally to $3,000/oz. at 40%,\n\nLearn, act,\n\nand donate\n\nto fight against\n\nracial injustice.\n\nfe\n\n— oe ee ee\n\n~\n\n| love\n\n| has\n\nBow\n\nno\n\n| labels\n\n—_—\n\n|\n\nPowered by |S Livelntent\n\nAdChoices [>\n\nRally continues\n\nU.S. stock index futures are looking to extend gains as traders await progress from Washington on a new coronavirus aid\n\npackage. \"I think the expectation for the market 1s that we are going to get that stimulus,” Ally Invest's Lindsay Bell told CNBC.\n\nBetter-than-expected camings from Disney (NYSE:DIS) are also helping sentiment (see below), while closely-watched\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) will report before the opening bell. On the trade front, reports suggest that U.S. trade\n\nrepresentative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu will meet in mid-August to discuss the Phase Once trade deal\n\nbetween the U.S. and China.\n\nMCK-MAAG-2608752\n\n=== Page 2 ===\nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/nxcw0256\n\n=== Page 2 Image 1 (OCR) ===\n100 million streaming subscribers\n\nWhile Disney (DIS) continued to feel the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sectors like its parks business, where revenue\n\ntanked 85% from a year earlier, CEO Bob Chapek announced a new streaming service that will launch in fiscal 2021 under the\n\nStar brand acquired from Fox (NASDAQ:FOX). In total, Disney now has 100M paid subscribers across its streaming services,\n\nwhich include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Disney+ reached 60.5M paid subscribers, hitting a goal of 6(0M-90M subscriptions\n\nby 2024, four years carly.\n\nGo deeper: Disney call: Cinemas slip on ‘Mulan’ news.\n\nWild ride for Novavax\n\nAt one point in after-hours trading on Tuesday, Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) was down 32% after STAT News reported that\n\neight participants in a Phase | clinical trial evaluating COVID-19 vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373 had to be hospitalized.\n\nThat data was later found to be erroneous and shares are now up 17% premarket (the stock has rallied 3,800% YTD). Novavax's\n\ntwo-injection regimen when administered with its immune-boosting technology generated antibody responses that were four\n\ntimes higher than those seen in people who had recovered from the disease.\n\nBeirut blast\n\nLebanon 1s cyeing a state of emergency following a massive explosion that rocked Beirut with the force of a 3.5 magnitude\n\nearthquake on Tuesday and caused widespread damage across the capital. At least 100 people were killed and more than 4,000\n\nwounded, while local officials linked the blast to some 2,750 tons of confiscated ammonium nitrate that were being stored at a\n\nport warehouse for the past six years. It's been a rough ride for the country's economy. Lebanon's GDP fell 6.9% in 2019, while\n\nthe Lebanese pound has lost over 60% of its value in just the past month, and 80% of its value since October.\n\nOpioid epidemic\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is demanding OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma pay as much as $18.1B in penalties as part of\n\nits bankruptcy reorganization plan, WS/ reports. On the civil side, the DOJ is secking $2.8B - which could be tripled under the\n\nlaw - for tax dollars spent battling the U.S. opioid epidemic, as well as kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies and transferring\n\ncash to hide money from creditors. On the criminal side, federal prosecutors want Purdue to pay a $6.2B fine and the forfeiture\n\nof potentially $3.5B more over marketing and distribution that violated criminal statutes including anti-kickback laws,\n\nmisbranding under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and conspiracy.\n\nTale of two companies\n\nSir Richard Branson plans to fly on a Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) spaceship next year after the company settled on an carly\n\n2021 date for its first passenger flight. That assumes both demonstration flights go as planned in the fall and yield the \"expected\n\nresults.\" Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic 1s seeking Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York as it\n\ntrics to nail down a £1.2B rescue plan. Under the proposal, Virgin Group will retain its 51% controlling stake in the airline,\n\nwhile partner Delta (NYSE:DAL) will continue to hold the remaining 49%.\n\nMeet the teenager allegedly behind the Twitter hack\n\nGraham Ivan Clark, 17, of Tampa, Fla., convinced a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) employee that he was a co-worker, according to\n\nprosecutors, and seized control of a phone number via SIM-swapping. He also sct up several fake phishing pages, including one\n\nMCK-MAAG-2608752.000001\n\n=== Page 3 ===\nSource:  https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/docs/nxcw0256\n\n=== Page 3 Image 1 (OCR) ===\nthat resembled the company’s Okta login portal, a destination used for securely logging into company systems. Once inside,\n\nClark, who entered a not-guilty plea in court Monday, allegedly gained the ability to bypass Twitter's security protections,\n\nsetting the stage for an hourslong hack on July 15 that held hostage the main communications tool of some of the most powerful\n\npeople on the planet.\n\nMore misconduct\n\nOne of the most prominent trade secret cases in recent years has come to a close as Anthony Levandowski was sentenced to 18\n\nmonths in prison (his incarceration will be delayed until after the COVID-19 pandemic). Levandowski had been a key engineer\n\nat Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo before starting his own self-driving truck company called Otto. The latter was\n\neventually bought by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), where he became the head of its self-driving unit, but Levandowski\n\neventually pleaded guilty to taking thousands of files from his former employer when he left in 2016.\n\nWhat else is happening...\n\nFed 1s expected to commit to push inflation higher.\n\nKodak (NYSE:KODK) reportedly under SEC investigation over drug deal disclosure.\n\nFord (NYSE:F) elevates COO Jim Farley to CEO position.\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) to lay off 25% of employees in pandemic measure.\n\nAnother delay for Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) same-day delivery service.\n\nEU launches probe into Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) acquisition.\n\nTuesday's Key Earnings\n\nActivision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) -1.4% AH despite strong Q2, upbeat guidance.\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) -9.9% AH weighed down by heavy costs.\n\nNikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) -13.4% AH reporting wider loss, light on details.\n\nSquare (NYSE:SQ) +9.6% AH posting a 64% jump in revenue.\n\nTwilio (NYSE: TWLO) -4.1% AH despite beating expectations.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS) +6.1% AH reporting 100M paid streaming subscribers.\n\nToday's Markets\n\nIn Asia, Japan -0.3%.
